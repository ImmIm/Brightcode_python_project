## Project steps:
- Part 1: Creating an architecture of project and class diagramm
- Part 2: Implementing game logic and playing PvP
- Part 3: Creaating simple AI
- Part 4: Creating complex Ai with Min-Max algorytm
## Lessons learned and difficulties in implementing

I've learned how create an architecture of a project. How to structure it and create after. To be honest, this was the most hard task, because errors and mistakes on this part of project lead to huge trouble after. That's why after writing game itself I've decide to rewrite all from the very beginning.

I've learned how to create class heirachy and make connections with all parts of project. 
Also making an AI was interesting task, which also provide good testing mechanics, which makes writing other parts of project faster.

This was incredible experience, but many was not finished. I've tried to develop with TDD, but it was harder that I've thought.
Also test coverage is poor. Hope that I'll learn this lesson.
